//JavaScript Variables
//Exercise 1
Create a variable called carName, assign the value Volvo to it.
let carName = "Volvo";

//Exercise 2
Create a variable called x, assign the value 50 to it.
let x = 50

//Exercise 3
Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables: x and y.
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + y;

//Exercise 4
Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result in an alert box.
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y;
alert (z);

//Exercise 5
On one single line, declare three variables with the following names and values:

firstName = "John" lastName = "Doe" age = 35
let firstName = "John", lastName = 'Doe' age = 35;

//JavaScript Operations
//Exercise 1
Multiply 10 with 5, and alert the result:
alert(10 * 5);

//Exercise 2
Divide 10 by 2, and alert the result:
alert(10 / 2);

//Exercise 3
Alert the remainder when 15 is divided by 9.
alert(15 % 9);

//Exercise 4
Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 15 (same as x = x + y).
x = 10;
y = 5;
x += y;

//Exercise 5
Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y).
x = 10;
y = 5;
x *= y;

//Javascript Data Types
//Exercise 1
Use comments to describe the correct data type of the following variables:
let length = 16;          // Number
let lastName = "Johnson"; // String
const x = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};                        // Object

//JavaSvcript Functions
//Exercise 1
Execute the function named myFunction.
function myFunction() {
  alert("Hello World!");
}
myFunction();
//Exercise 2
Create a function called "myFunction".
function myFunction() {
 alert("Hello World!");
}

//Exercise 3
Make the function return "Hello".
function myFunction() {  
return "Hello";
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myFunction();

//Exercise 4
Make the function display "Hello" in the inner HTML of an element with the ID "demo".
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById ("demo").innerHTML = "Hello";
}

//JavaScript Objects
//Exercise 1
Alert "John" by extracting information from the person object.
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};

alert(person.firstName);

//Exercise 2
Add the following property and value to the person object: country: Norway.

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
,
country: "Norway"
};

//Exercise 3
Create an object called person with name = John, age = 50.
Then, access the object to alert("John is 50").

const person = {
  name: "John", age : 50};
alert(person.name + " is " + person.age);
