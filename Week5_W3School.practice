//Convert the text into an UPPERCASE text:

let txt = "Hello World!";
txt = txt.toUpperCase();

//Exercise 2

let txt = "I can eat bananas all day";
let x = txt.slice(10, 17);

//Exercise 3
//Use the correct String method to replace the word "Hello" with the word "Welcome".

//Exercise 4
//Convert the value of txt to upper case.

let txt = "Hello World";
txt = txt.toUpperCase();

//Exercise 5
//Convert the value of txt to lower case.

let txt = "Hello World";
txt =txt.toLowerCase();

//JavaScript Arrays

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let x = cars[1];

//Exercise 2
//Change the first item of cars to "Ford".

const cars = ["Volvo", "Jeep", "Mercedes"];
cars[0] = "Ford";

//Exercise 3
//Alert the number of items in an array, using the correct Array property.

const cars = ["Volvo", "Jeep", "Mercedes"];
alert(cars.length);

//JavaScript Arrays Methods

//Exercise 1
//Use the correct Array method to remove the last item of the fruits array.

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits.pop();

//Exercise 2
//Use the correct Array method to add "Kiwi" to the fruits array.

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits.push("Kiwi");

//Exercise 3
//Use the splice() method to remove "Orange" and "Apple" from fruits.

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Kiwi"];
fruits.splice(1, 2);
