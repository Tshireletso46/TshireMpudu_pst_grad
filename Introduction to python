//Python Syntax

//Exercise 1 (Insert the missing part of the code below to output "Hello World".
...("Hello World")
print("Hello World")

//Exercise 2 (Complete the code block, print "YES" if 5 is larger than 2.)
//Hint: remember the indentation.
if 5 > 2:
    print("YES")

//Python Comments

// Exercise 1 (Comments in Python are written with a special character, which one?)


...This is a comment
#This is a comment

//Exercise 2 (Use a multiline string to make the a multiline comment:)
...This is a comment

//Python Variables

// Exercise 1 (reate a variable named carname and assign the value Volvo to it.)
carname = "Volvo"

//Exercise 2 (Create a variable named x and assign the value 50 to it.)
x = 50

//Exercise 3 (Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables: x and y.)
... = ...
y = 10
print(x...y)

x = 5
y = x 10
print(x + y)

//Exercise 4 (Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result.)
x = 5
y = 10
...= x + y
print(...)

x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)

//Exercise 5 (Insert the correct syntax to assign values to multiple variables in one line:)
x  y z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

//Exercise 6 (Insert the correct syntax to assign the same value to all three variables in one code line.)
x  y  z  "Orange"

x = y = z = "Orange"

//Exercise 7 (Insert the correct keyword to make the variable x belong to the global scope.)
def myfunc(): 
            x
x = "fantastic"

def myfunc(): 
global x
x = "fantastic"
